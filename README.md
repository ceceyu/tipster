# tipster
A simple tip calculator (part of the Codepath 2015 application)

Time spent: 4 hours, including watching the video tutorial and sketching up reference designs

Completed Tasks
- (Required) Tip calculator works 
- (Optional) Changed colors and fonts of some views
- (Optional) Didn't add a custom font, but added image assets in place of custom font text
- (Optional) Added app icon and loading image
- (Optional) Made keyboard show up on app load for better usability

## Designs

I started by creating a reference design to figure out what tweaks I might want to make to the default UI. The first thing I noticed during the tutorial is that there isn't a good reason why you should have to click into the billField to launch the keyboard. Since it's the only action you can take, the keyboard should be persistent. In general, I wanted it to have the feel of a paper receipt, down to the typefaces and colors.

## Walkthrough

I didn't have time to do everything, but I'd like to try later. Here's a GIF walkthrough:
